        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my B.Tech and exploring the field of Software
          Development. My journey began with learning HTML, where I started
          building simple web pages to understand how websites are
          structured.<br /><br />

          Alongside Web Development, I am also learning Data Structures &
          Algorithms to strengthen my problem-solving skills and logical
          thinking. I believe that combining development with strong
          fundamentals is essential to becoming a good engineer.<br /><br />

          As a beginner, my focus is on consistent learning, building real
          projects, and improving every day. My goal is to become a skilled
          Software Engineer capable of creating meaningful and impactful
          technology.
